# AlgorithmVisualizer
Algorithm Visualizer helps you to visualise all types of Sorting Algorithms. Here i have implemented 5 types of Sorting Algorithms i.e
1. Selection Sort
2. Bubble Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

I was not able to visualize and implemented the Heap Sort, so if you have a better understanding of Heap Sort then you can contribute here. In future i will be adding Graph Algorithms.
